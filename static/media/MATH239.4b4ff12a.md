I, personally, did not find the enumeration unit useful so I will not be reviewing that here. Graph theory on the other hand was pretty useful.

## Introduction to Graph Theory

### Definitions

A graph $G$ is a finite non-empty set, $V(G)$, of vertices together with a set, $E(G)$, of unordered pair of distinct vertices. These are called *edges*.

Vertices adjacent to a vertex $u$ are called *neighbours* of $u$ denoted with the set $N(u)$.

A graph which can be drawn without any edges crossing is called *planar*

### Isomorphism

Two graphs $G_1, G_2$ are *isomorphic* if there exists a bijection $f : V(G_1) \to V(G_2)$
