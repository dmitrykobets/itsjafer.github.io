## Timeline

1. Starting in October 2018, I started to apply externally to jobs in the USA. I continued to apply well through December.
   1. I received countless rejections, 2 coding challenges (Treyarch, HBO), 0 interviews, 0 offers.
2. In January, the WaterlooWorks cycle started. By January 23rd, I'd applied to 50 jobs; 40 in the states, 10 in Canada.
3. In February (thus far), out of 50 apps, I received 18 rejections, 2 coding challenges, 3 interviews, 1 offer.

## Preparation

I didn't do nearly as much preparation as I would've liked. 

Here's what I *should* have done:

* Leetcode problems everyday
* Worked on a data science side project
* Gotten better grades

Instead, I didn't start preparing until mid to late January where I started to do leetcode challenges every few days.

## Challenges with external applications

Every single external internship in the USA would specify *graduation date in 2020 or earlier* in an effort to secure third and fourth year students. Unfortunately, my program is five years; as a result many employers seemed to equate the *2021* graduation date with me being a second year student.

GPA -- whereas applications on WaterlooWorks don't need to ask for GPA (they have our transcripts already), every US employer would ask for it and considering mine was on the lower range, this often screened me out against the vast selection of candidates.

## Applying to WaterlooWorks

The jury's still out on whether I applied too ambitiously; my last co-op hunt, I received over 15 interviews after applying only in Canada and this term I wanted to push myself to see if I could get a job in the states. with 80% of applications in the states, I was really pushing my luck to try to secure a co-op.

A week after applications closed and nothing had come to fruition. Whereas by this time last cycle I had 5 interviews, right now I had none. 

### What went wrong

First, I did not apply to jobs very tactically; I applied to big companies but in roles that didn't suit me. I also applied to small companies in roles where I had no experience; I was essentially giving away one of my 50 applications.


Luckily, things started to snow ball; I flopped on the Yelp coding challenge but I got an interview for Vida Health. The day of that interview, I received a short-notice invitation to interview for Tesla. Following that, I got a video interview with SAS institute and a coding challenge from The Trade Desk (which went well).

There's still a month of potential interviews left so there's a lot to update here.
